	<p>Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. Oh, yeah. The guy in the ,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. Oh, yeah. The guy in the ,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON!</p>

  <p>
    We are gittin' ready!
